Netflix Stocks Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn


Introduction
In this project, we acted as a data visualization developer at Yahoo Finance! We helped the "Netflix Stock Profile" team visualize the Netflix stock data. In finance, stock profile is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects a publicly traded company's data.

For the purposes of the project, we only visualized data for the year of 2017. Specifically, we were in charge of creating the following visualizations:

The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017
During this project, we analyzed, prepared, and plotted data. Our visualizations helped the financial analysts asses the risk of the Netflix stock.

After completion our visualizations, we're creating a presentation to share the images with the rest of the Netflix Stock Profile team.
